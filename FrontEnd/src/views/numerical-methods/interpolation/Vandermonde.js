            <h2>Vandermonde</h2>
            <p>The **Vandermonde matrix** is a type of matrix often used in interpolation problems, polynomial fitting,
              and solving systems of linear equations involving polynomial coefficients. It is named after the French
              mathematician **Alexis Thérèse Petit**.</p>

            <p>A **Vandermonde matrix** is a matrix with the following structure: each row of the matrix corresponds to
              a set of powers of a set of distinct variables (usually denoted as <InlineMath
                math="x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n "/>).</p>

            <h3> Definition of the Vandermonde Matrix</h3>

            <p>Given a set of distinct numbers <InlineMath math="x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n "/>, the corresponding Vandermonde
              matrix <InlineMath math="V "/> is an <InlineMath math="n \times n "/> matrix defined as follows:</p>

            <BlockMath math="
              V = \begin{bmatrix}
              1 & x_1 & x_1^2 & \dots & x_1^{n-1} \\
              1 & x_2 & x_2^2 & \dots & x_2^{n-1} \\
              \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
              1 & x_n & x_n^2 & \dots & x_n^{n-1}
              \end{bmatrix}
              "/>

            <h3> Example of a Vandermonde Matrix</h3>

            <p>For a set of 3 points <InlineMath math="x_1 = 1, x_2 = 2, x_3 = 3 "/>, the Vandermonde matrix is:</p>

            <BlockMath math="
              V = \begin{bmatrix}
              1 & 1 & 1^2 \\
              1 & 2 & 2^2 \\
              1 & 3 & 3^2
              \end{bmatrix}
              =
              \begin{bmatrix}
              1 & 1 & 1 \\
              1 & 2 & 4 \\
              1 & 3 & 9
              \end{bmatrix}
              "/>

            <h3> Applications of the Vandermonde Matrix</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>**Polynomial Interpolation**:
                <p>The Vandermonde matrix is often used in polynomial interpolation problems. Given a set of data
                  points <InlineMath math="(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \dots, (x_n, y_n) "/>, the goal is to find a
                  polynomial <InlineMath math="P(x) "/> of degree at most <InlineMath math="n-1 "/> such that:</p>
                <BlockMath math="
   P(x_i) = y_i \quad \text{for} \quad i = 1, 2, \dots, n
   "/>
                <p>This can be written as a system of linear equations:</p>
                <BlockMath math="
   V \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{y}
   "/>
                <p>where <InlineMath math="\mathbf{c} "/> is the vector of polynomial coefficients, and <InlineMath
                  math="\mathbf{y} "/> is the vector of known values <InlineMath math="y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n "/>. The
                  solution to this system gives the coefficients of the interpolating polynomial.</p>
              </li>

              <li>Solving Polynomial Systems**:
                <p>In numerical methods, Vandermonde matrices are also used in solving systems where the unknowns are
                  the coefficients of polynomials that fit or approximate a given set of data points.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Numerical Approximation**:
                <p>Vandermonde matrices are used in various numerical approximation techniques, such as **least squares
                  fitting**, where they help represent polynomial models for data fitting problems.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Determinants and Systems of Equations**:
                <p>A key property of the Vandermonde matrix is that its determinant has a closed-form expression. For a
                  Vandermonde matrix <InlineMath math="V "/> with distinct values <InlineMath
                    math="x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n "/>, the determinant is:</p>
                <BlockMath math="
   \text{det}(V) = \prod_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} (x_j - x_i)
   "/>
                <p>This means that the determinant is non-zero as long as all the <InlineMath math="x_i "/>'s are
                  distinct. This property ensures that the system of equations involving the Vandermonde matrix has a
                  unique solution if the <InlineMath math="x_i "/>'s are distinct.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h3> Solving a System Involving a Vandermonde Matrix</h3>

            <p>Consider the system of equations:</p>
            <BlockMath math="
V \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{y}
"/>
            <p>where <InlineMath math="V "/> is the Vandermonde matrix and <InlineMath math="\mathbf{y} "/> is a vector
              of values. To find the coefficients <InlineMath math="\mathbf{c} "/>, the system can be solved using
              standard methods like **Gaussian elimination**, **LU decomposition**, or **matrix inversion**, assuming
              the matrix <InlineMath math="V "/> is invertible (i.e., the <InlineMath math="x_i "/>'s are distinct).</p>

            <h3> Challenges and Considerations</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Numerical Stability**:
                <p>While the Vandermonde matrix has a closed-form determinant expression, it is known to be numerically
                  unstable for large <InlineMath math="n "/> or for closely spaced values of <InlineMath math="x_i "/>'s.
                  This instability arises because the matrix elements grow quickly in magnitude, leading to issues with
                  floating-point precision during computation.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Condition Number**:
                <p>The **condition number** of the Vandermonde matrix grows exponentially with the size of the matrix
                  and the spacing of the <InlineMath math="x_i "/>'s. A high condition number indicates that the matrix
                  is ill-conditioned, and solving the system will be prone to large numerical errors. For large systems,
                  **regularization techniques** or **alternative interpolation methods** like **Barycentric
                  interpolation** may be preferred.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h3> Summary</h3>

            <p>The **Vandermonde matrix** is an important structure in numerical methods, especially for polynomial
              interpolation and least squares fitting. Its entries are formed by powers of distinct variables, and it is
              used to represent systems of equations where the unknowns are the coefficients of a polynomial. Despite
              its widespread use, the Vandermonde matrix can be prone to numerical instability and ill-conditioning,
              especially for large matrices or closely spaced variables.</p>
