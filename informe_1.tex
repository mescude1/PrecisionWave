\section{System Name (Project)}
The application will be named PrecisionWave as it suggests the continuous and smooth flow of calculations and data processing, which can be appealing in the context of complex algorithms that operate seamlessly.

\section{Project Description}

The project's end goal is the production of a numerical analysis method library in both Python and (insert another language with a big float implementation here) with a front end that will be able to utilize the library to conduct numerical analysis and provides a front-end for visualization, data entry and the export of experiment results.

\section{Possible Added Value}

Since the application will be supported by a database it could be possible to hold calculation results and use said results to conduct further analysis to facilitate the creation of models within the application.
